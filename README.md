# Linear Regression from Scratch with PyTorch

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Generate synthetic data for linear regression.  
- Define model parameters manually (`w`, `b`).  
- Implement forward pass, mean squared error (MSE) loss, and gradient descent.  
- Train the model iteratively using PyTorch’s autograd.  
- Evaluate performance and visualize results.

## ⚙️ Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install torch matplotlib jupyter
````

---

## ▶️ Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-pytorch.git
   cd linear-regression-pytorch
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook PyTorch.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the notebook cells step by step to:

   * Generate synthetic dataset
   * Train the regression model
   * Visualize predictions

## 📊 Example Results

* Training loss decreases over iterations.
* Learned weights (`w`) and bias (`b`) approximate the true values used to generate synthetic data.
* Final plot shows regression line fitting the noisy data points.
